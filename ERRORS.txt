404 - Not Found
 - Resource not found. Ensure correct file paths, query parameters, and that routes exist.

Database connection issues

Booking conflicts
 - When double-booking occurs, the system rejects overlapping bookings. The user sees a friendly message: "Room already has a booking overlapping your requested time.".

Validation errors
 - The app uses session flash messages for user-visible validation errors (e.g., invalid datetimes, missing fields). Check the displayed message on the page.

Email/PDF Issues
 - PDF generation requires Dompdf (composer install). Email using SMTP requires `includes/smtp_config.php` to be populated. Check logs/errors.log and vendor autoload.

For developers: enable display_errors in dev and consult `logs/errors.log` (create this file if missing with writable permissions).
